# python-exercises

A compilation of exercises written in python.

# introduction

This repository consists of basic training exercises written in python that demonstrate: a progression of syntax in python and overall programming ability as a first semester freshman at Rhodes College within the language.

# main takeaways

This repository consists of exercises that:

* demonstrate basic programming ideas within a new language for me at the time;
* demonstrates the learning of basic syntax and properties within python.
* progression from beginner usage of python to more experienced syntax and usage.

# conclusion

This repository's purpose is mainly to show ability to code within Python with proper syntax; not to demonstrate complex programming ability as all of these exercises were written during my first semester of coding.
